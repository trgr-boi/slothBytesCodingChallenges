# TimeFormatter
## Challenge (mail)
### 12 vs 24 Hours
Create a function that converts 12-hour time to 24-hour time or vice versa. Return the output as a string.
#### Examples
```
convertTime("12:00 am")
output = "0:00"

convertTime("6:20 pm")
output = "18:20"

convertTime("21:00")
output = "9:00 pm"

convertTime("5:05")
output ="5:05 am"
```
#### Notes
- A 12-hour time input will be denoted with an am or pm suffix.
- A 24-hour input time contains no suffix.
## SelfNote
I made 2 versions; a simple one and a application one.
The simple one is the core of the challenge. It only runs once and has nothing extra.
The application one loops until you quit. Not that it really had a lot of funtion but I just like to make it this way :).
